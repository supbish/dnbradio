# dnbradio stuff for thelounge

This stuff is external to thelounge.
We can do a few things with their [server API](https://thelounge.chat/docs/api).

1. Clone this repo into `.thelounge/packages/node_modules`.
2. Add the dependency in `.thelounge/packages/package.json`:
  ```json
  "dependencies": { "dnbradio": "*" }
  ```
3. Check [this commit](https://github.com/supbish/thelounge/commit/b1de4d131a) for client side stuff.
